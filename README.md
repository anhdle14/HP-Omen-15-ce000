## Preface
---
So if you haven't noticed the specs of the laptop. You will probably guess, this laptop looks a lot like a PC. However, a lot of the post-installation is by following Rehabman Guide on TonymacX86. The pre-installation is by following /r/hackintosh. So please check the guide based on that.

> Note about the laptop model:
- Some of the high-end laptop disable iGPU be default, in order to run a higher refresh rate Display Panel. So If you coming from a low-end model HP Omen laptop, please reading and following the Rehabman Laptop Guide. E.g: GTX 1050ti or lower will be using iGPU.
- During pre-installation, things should be different based on model. But for the post-installation, i have been helping other people to get stuffs working, and it is basically the same process.

## Requirements
---
- A Working MacOS.
- USB3/USB2 8GB or more.
- 40$ for the Wifi. Ignore if that is not what you are looking forward to have.
- Reading, and don't expect to be spoonfed.

## Guide
---
> As i was saying before, but this guide is not for laptop with iGPU enabled.
